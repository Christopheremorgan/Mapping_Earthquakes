# Mapping_Earthquakes
Mapping GeoJSON earthquake data with JS, Leaflet and D3

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.  GeoJSON earthquake data is retrieved from the USGS website URL, which includes geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. To add the data to a map JavaScript and the D3.js library are used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library is used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
