# Mapping_Earthquakes
Mapping GeoJSON earthquake data with JS, Leaflet and D3

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.  GeoJSON earthquake data is retrieved from the USGS website URL, which includes geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. To visualize the data on a map, JavaScript and the D3.js library are used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library is used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.


## Using the Erathquake Dashboard

There are multiple map layers and overlays that can be toggled on and off through a control in top right corner of the page.  There is also a legend on the bottom right of the page to map the color of the circlemarkers to the relative magnitude of the earhquakes.
